Welcome to ElectroKid, a hub where curiosity meets innovation! My name is Samridh Sehgal, and since 2025, I have been working on a variety of electronics and IoT projects. I’m passionate about building innovative hardware projects that blend creativity, electronics, and code. From RC planes and drones to smart IoT systems, I love experimenting, designing, and bringing ideas to life.

# About Me
⚡ Since childhood, I’ve been curious about how electronics work — always opening up gadgets and exploring the circuits inside. That curiosity has now grown into a passion for building creative and smart hardware projects.

Featured Projects
# 1. Dino Game on 32*8 LED Strips
I made a 32×8 LED matrix Dino Game just for fun using an Arduino Uno. It’s a mini version of the classic Chrome Dino, where the dino jumps over obstacles displayed on the LED strip — a simple yet creative electronics project built for experimenting and learning.
