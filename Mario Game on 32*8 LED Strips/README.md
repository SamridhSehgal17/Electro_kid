# 🎮 Customised Gyro Gamepad  
A fun DIY Mario-style Dino Jump Game built on a 32×8 LED matrix using an Arduino Uno.
This project creates a retro pixel-style obstacle game, where the character jumps over incoming obstacles — perfect for learning basic game logic, LED animations, and timing control.

# 📷 Project Overview
The 32×8 LED matrix is arranged like a horizontal display.
Mario stays on the left side, while obstacles continuously move from the right.

How the game works:

1.Arduino Uno controls all 256 LEDs of the 32×8 matrix.
2.A small Mario sprite is shown near the left side.
3.Obstacles (vertical blocks) spawn on the right side.
4.The screen scrolls left, giving the illusion of running.
5.When you press the button → Mario jumps.
6.If Mario touches an obstacle → Game Over.
A simple and fun LED-matrix arcade game!
